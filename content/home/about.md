# About Me


I'm an Applied Scientist in Amazon Alexa, where I participate in the development, evaluation and deployment of machine learning models and analytical solutions with an emphasis in personalizing the Alexa experience. The team's end goal is to deliver an instantly familiar personal assistant for our customers through the application of cutting-edge scientific techniques

I was previously a Data Scientist at the Innovation and Research Team in the [Amadeus IT Group](http://www.amadeus.com/ "Amadeus's Homepage") . My main activities included conceptualizing new research ideas, developing prototypes and performing data analysis for applications in the travel industry.

In 2014 I obtained my Ph.D. in Automation and Signal Processing in [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/centre/sophia "INRIA's Homepage") and the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (France). My thesis was entitled ["Axonal Morphology Analysis: From Image Processing to Modeling"](https://hal.inria.fr/tel-01074620 "PhD Thesis") and focused on the morphological analysis and classification of axonal trees using different mathematical and machine learning techniques.

I have received two Master degrees: a M.Sc. in Computational Biology and Biomedicine from the  [University of Nice Sophia Antipolis](http://unice.fr/ "University of Nice Sophia Antipolis Homepage") (France)  and an Electrical Engineering Degree from the [Universidad de la Republica](http://www.universidad.edu.uy/ "Universidad de la Republica Homepage") (Uruguay).

During my PhD years I was also a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Informatics of the University of Nice. 
I have also worked as an Integration Engineer in [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/uy "Ericsson's Homepage") (Uruguay) and as a Research Assistant in the Electrical Engineering Department of the Universidad de la Republica (Uruguay).
