The analysis and comparison of tree-like shapes is of great
importance since many structures in nature can be described by them. In
the field of biomedical imaging, trees have been used to describe
structures such as neurons, blood vessels and lung airways.Since it is
known that their morphology provides information on their functioning
and allows the characterization of pathological states, it is of
paramount importance to develop methods to analyze their shape and to
quantify differences in structures.In this paper, we present a new method
for comparing tree-like shapes that takes into account both topological
and geometrical information. It is based on the Elastic Shape
Analysis Framework, a framework originally designed for comparing shapes
of 3D closed curves in Euclidean spaces. As a first application, we used
our method for the comparison of axon morphology. The performance
was tested on a group of 44 (20 normal and 24 mutant) 3D images,
each containing one axonal tree. We have calculated inter and intra
class distances between them and implemented a basic classification
scheme.Results showed that the proposed method better distinguishes
between the two populations than a pure topological metric. Furthermore,
mean shapes can be obtained with this method.
