<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In this
work we propose a 2D discrete stochastic
model for the simulation of axonal biogenesis. The model is
defined by a third order Markov Chain. The model considers
two main processes: the growth process that models the elongation
and shape of the neurites and the bifurcation process that
models the generation of branches. The growth process depends,
among other variables, on the external attraction field generated
by a chemo attractant molecule secreted by the target area. We
propose an estimation scheme of the involved parameters from
real fluorescent confocal microscopy images of single neurons
within intact adult Drosophila fly brains. Both normal neurons
and neurons in which certain genes were inactivated have been
considered (two mutations). In total, 53 images (18 normal, 21
type 1 mutant and 14 type 2 mutant) were used. The model
parameters allow us to describe pathological characteristics of
the mutated populations.</p>
