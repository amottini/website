<p style='text-align: justify;'>
We present an integrated software designed to help nuclear
medicine physicians in the detection of epileptogenic zones (EZ) by
means of ictal-interictal SPECT and MR images. This tool was designed to
be flexible, friendly and efficient. A novel detection method was
included(A-contrario) along with the classical detection method
(Subtraction analysis). The softwareâ€™s performance was evaluated with
two separate sets of validation studies: visual interpretation of
12patient images by an experimented observer and objective analysis
of virtual brain phantom experiments by proposed numerical observers.
Our results support the potential use of the proposed software to
help nuclear medicine physicians in the detection of EZ in clinical
practice.
