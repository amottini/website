abstract = "We present an integrated software designed to help nuclear medicine physicians in the detection of epileptogenic zones (EZ) by means of ictal-interictal SPECT and MR images. This tool was designed to be flexible, friendly and efficient. A novel detection method was included(A-contrario) along with the classical detection method (Subtraction analysis). The softwareâ€™s performance was evaluated with two separate sets of validation studies: visual interpretation of 12patient images by an experimented observer and objective analysis of virtual brain phantom experiments by proposed numerical observers. Our results support the potential use of the proposed software to help nuclear medicine physicians in the detection of EZ in clinical practice."
