abstract = "A-contrario (AC) theory considers Gestalt grouping laws to determine the presence of a structure given a background model. This method arises from formal deduction and no arbitrary parameters are involved. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of this algorithm in the detection of epiloptogenic zones (EZ) in SPECT images in patients and virtual phantoms compared with Subtraction analysis (SA)."
