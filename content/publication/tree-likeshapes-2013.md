abstract = "The analysis and comparison of tree-like shapes is of great importance since many structures in nature can be described by them. In the field of biomedical imaging, trees have been used to describe structures such as neurons, blood vessels and lung airways.Since it is known that their morphology provides information on their functioning and allows the characterization of pathological states, it is of paramount importance to develop methods to analyze their shape and to quantify differences in structures.In this paper, we present a new method for comparing tree-like shapes that takes into account both topological and geometrical information. It is based on the Elastic Shape Analysis Framework, a framework originally designed for comparing shapes of 3D closed curves in Euclidean spaces. As a first application, we used our method for the comparison of axon morphology. The performance was tested on a group of 44 (20 normal and 24 mutant) 3D images, each containing one axonal tree. We have calculated inter and intra class distances between them and implemented a basic classification scheme.Results showed that the proposed method better distinguishes between the two populations than a pure topological metric. Furthermore, mean shapes can be obtained with this method."
